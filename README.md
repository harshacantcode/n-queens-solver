# n-queens-solver
A python programme that generates a solution to the n queens problem using backtracking.
An observation that can be made is that a solution exists for all natural numbers except 2 and 3.
Instead of using the python command x ** y to find x^y, I have used a function that makes it clear as to why the time complexity
of that operation is O(log(n))
